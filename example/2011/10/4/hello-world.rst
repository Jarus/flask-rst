Hello World
===========

:public: True
:tags: ["hello", "world"]
:summary: "A very simple blog post"

This is my first blog post with `flask-rst <https://github.com/jarus/flask-rst/>`_.

If you activated the pygments module than you get a pretty syntax highlighting.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    print "Hello World"
    5 + 5    

For a simple console output:

::
    
    flask-rst runserver
    
Listing is very clean:

- Accessories for my MacBook
    - charger
        - international noses
